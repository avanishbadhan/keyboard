This project is a modular wired keyboard, consisting of a 75% keyboard with an attachable macropad. 
I made this project as a way to learn a variety of things including Schematic and PCB design, as it was my first time working with these; and also to practice some CAD. I have always wanted to know how keyboards work in general, as I use them every single day, and thought this might be a great way to learn, given the opportunity from Hack Club's Blueprint to bring my ideas to life.
Here are some images of CAD and PCB Design, BOM at the end.
