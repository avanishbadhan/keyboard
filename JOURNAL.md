## 10/26/2025 - designed a schematic and pcb  

started with keyboard layout on keyboard layout editor, designed a prototype schematic and pcb for a 75% keyboard on kicad using diodes. needs rework to find placement for microcontroller.

## 10/28/2025 - wired up the pcb, switched to nice!nano  

Wired up the PCB, front and back, connecting the diodes and switches, to the nice!nano.
Made some fixes, may need some more or rework, many design rule errors. 
Had to fix schematic rows and columns due to mistakes, overlapping wiring.

## 11/3/2025 - created schematic and pcb for number pad  

I created the schematic and pcb design for the number pad macropad I plan to have on the side. I wanted this to be detachable from the main keyboard as I do not use it often. This PCB runs without errors, and I moved to this as it gave me a good start to KiCad as I am new to the software and faced some issues starting off with a big PCB.

## 11/6/2025 - 3d components and rotary encoder  

I added 3d components such as all the key switches onto both pcbs. I added a rotary encoder on the top right of my 75% keyboard to control volume. Was missing STAB keys on the macropad which I had to fix up. Will need to make both microcontrollers match.

## 11/8/2025 - final touches  

Wrapped up both halves(keyboard + macropad) with a TRRS jack on both to connect them physically. 75% keyboard uses nice!nano and macropad uses pro micro. I took some time figuring out how to get the TRRS and understand how it works. I did not have space to include both the rotary encoder and TRRS jack on the main keyboard, so I ended up scrapping the rotary encoder for a simpler design, and the ability to connect both halves. Design rules all pass, will need to create case next.
